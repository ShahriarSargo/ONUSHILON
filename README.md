## ONUSHILON: Competitive Exam Practice

# THIS IS A CONCEPT WORK AND NOT MEANT TO BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL.

ONUSHILON is a platform that turns exam prep into something more engaging. Instead of just answering questions, you can choose between different quiz modes: casual practice, timed solo challenges, or competitive matches against AI opponents.  

Your progress is tracked through ranks and stats, and you can see how you compare on the leaderboard. Each subject (Physics, Chemistry, or Biology) comes with its own look and feel, so studying does not feel the same every time. The goal is simple: make preparation structured, motivating, and a little more fun.
